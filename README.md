# Hidden-Markov-Model
Implementation of Hidden Markov Models applied to the problem of Natural Language Processing. This project builds a basic English sentence recognizer and a non complex Hidden Markov Model. The vocabulary that it is limited to exclusively employs the words "kids", "robots", "do", "can", "play", "eat", "chess", and "food". The HMM implemented is expected to recognize and parse sentences. In addition, the HMM implemented handles various recognition tasks.
